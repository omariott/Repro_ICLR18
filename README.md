# Repro_ICLR18 : reproduction of Dynamically Expandable Networks

## This code is based on [this ICLR18 article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01547)

### To run code:

1. unzip data archive
2. run main.py using python 3.5

This produces a `figures/` directory and saves three plots :
- Online AUROC per task
- Offline AUROC per task
- Average AUROC after each task with timestamped inference (evaluation used in the original paper).

### Poster :
The `poster/` directory contains the pdf and the original latex files of the poster that illustrated this work.
